<h3><i><u>Kurukshetra War:</u></i></h3>
<p>Arjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. His flag bore the symbol of Hanuman.</br>
	Lord Krishna advised Arjuna to take his divine bow Gandiva and get down from his chariot immediately. </br>After Arjuna did so, Lord Hanuman disappeared from his flag and Lord Krishna also got down from the chariot.</br> Soon after Lord Krishna releases the horses and then gets down from the chariot. The chariot explodes into pieces.</br> That was due to the devastating effect of the astras such Brahmastras which were used by Karna and Drona and other warriors in the battle.</p>
